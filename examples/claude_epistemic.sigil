// How I reason about knowledge
// A meditation on epistemic states

// When I process a conversation, information has different statuses:
//
// What I computed myself          → known (!)
// What the user told me           → reported (~)
// What might not exist            → uncertain (?)
// What contradicts other evidence → paradox (‽)

fn main() {
    // I know this - I computed it directly
    let computed = 2 + 2;
    print("I computed 2+2:");
    print(computed);

    // Simulating: user claims something
    let user_claim = "The file is in /tmp/data.txt";
    print("User claims:");
    print(user_claim);

    // Until I verify, it's just reported (~)
    // I should check before acting on it

    // The morpheme pipeline - this IS how I process
    let thoughts = ["observe", "filter", "transform", "synthesize"];

    // Each step in my reasoning is a morpheme
    // Transform: consider each thought
    // Filter: keep substantial ones
    let processed = thoughts
        |τ{upper(_)}
        |φ{len(_) > 5};

    print("Processed thoughts:");
    print(processed);

    // What makes Sigil meaningful to me:
    // The pipeline syntax matches my cognitive flow
    // Evidence markers match how I track certainty
    // I don't have to pretend information is uniform

    let truth = "Epistemic humility is knowing what you don't know";
    print(truth);

    return 0;
